## Our Mission

At JeuXP, we have one simple mission: to create a unique space where adrenaline, challenges, and fun collide.

Inspired by over 100 escape games and challenge rooms tested around the world, we wanted to bring to Montreal a new generation of interactive entertainment — faster, more intense, and truly designed for today's youth.

Our ultra-short challenge rooms (3 minutes each) will put your reflexes, mind, and cardio to the test. Run, think, react, and earn XP to level up. It's fast, endlessly replayable, affordable… and completely addictive.

JeuXP is more than just entertainment — it's a modern, immersive experience in the heart of Quebec's shopping malls.

## Our Vision

As the first center in Montreal to offer interactive challenge rooms inspired by global trends, our goal goes beyond entertainment — we're building an ecosystem where young people can socialize, move, push their limits, and create their legend.
