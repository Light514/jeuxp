## General

**What is JeuXP?**  
JeuXP is a challenge center: you enter, play for 3 minutes per challenge, then step out! Your goal: beat your score, earn XP points, and reach all 5 levels. Each room tests your reflexes, cardio, or precision.

**Do I need to book in advance?**  
No reservation is required. Just show up whenever you want and play!

**How many people can play?**  
You can play solo or in a team of 2 to 4 players.

**What's the minimum age?**  
Access is not permitted for children under 6 years old. Players under 12 years old must be accompanied by an adult. We recommend ages 16 and up to fully enjoy the experience.

**Do I need to sign a waiver?**  
Yes. A liability waiver must be signed upon arrival before playing.
